> > - Display the converted temperature in Fahrenheit to the user.

## Question 2: Grade Calculator

> You are developing a grade calculator application in TypeScript. The program should take input from the user regarding their marks in three subjects and calculate their average grade.
>
> > Your task is to:
>
> - Prompt the user to enter their marks in three subjects (assuming each subject is out of 100).
> - Calculate the average grade by summing the marks and dividing by the total number of subjects.
> - Display the average grade to the user along with a corresponding letter grade based on the following criteria:
>   > - A: 90-100
>   > - B: 80-89
>   > - C: 70-79
>   > - D: 60-69
>   > - F: Below 60

## Question 3: Electricity Bill Estimator

> You are building an electricity bill estimator in TypeScript for a utility company. The program should estimate the electricity bill for a given number of units consumed.
>
> > Your task is to:
>
> - Prompt the user to enter the number of units consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
> - Calculate the total bill using the following rates:
> - $0.10 per kWh for the first 100 units.
> - $0.15 per kWh for the next 200 units.
> - $0.20 per kWh for any additional units beyond 300.
